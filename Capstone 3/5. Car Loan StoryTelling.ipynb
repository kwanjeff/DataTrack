I dropped the follow columns 'county','id','url','image_url','region_url','size','description' and 'VIN' because the data is inmeasuable or too many nulls.  For instance the column county was the most useless column because all rows of data were null.  Next to get rid of size as more than 75% of data was missing.  After getting rid of data I had only 17 columns left.\n",
